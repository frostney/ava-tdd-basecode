# AVA TDD Starterkit
TDD Starterkit with AVA & Babel 6

## How to get started

Initially, we have one JavaScript file that represents the logic of our code and one JavaScript file that tests said logic. This is meant only as a starting point.

### `lib/someLogic.js`
A small little file that is the base for what we are going to test. In this example it's just a function that returns a value.

### `test/someLogic.js`
The file that tests functions exported from `lib/someLogic.js`.

There's also a pre-commit hook defined which runs the tests before allowing to commit to the repository.
